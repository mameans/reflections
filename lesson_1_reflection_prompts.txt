How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    All common lines were stripped allowing focus on relevent lines.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Each mistake/change is recorded allowing one to learn from history

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Discretionary saves allow you to see mods organized logically,
    versus automatic saves which might be too granular obscuring
    common changes

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Changes may span multiple files so this allows grouping common
    changes

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Use log to locate meaning full files related to changes and diff to
    view the mods which would impact behavior.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    One can more easily revert changes which woud facitlitate experimentation

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    A couple for projects, What to Wear (WtW) and Cargo on Board (CoB)
